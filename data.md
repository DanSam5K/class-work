# A brief introduction about myself
- My name is Winnifred Akutsang Kaze, Nigerian by nationality.
I hail from Plateau state Nigeria, Afizere by tribe, a Jesus believer a devoted wife, sister and daughter. I enjoy writting fictional stories and sometimes write, I got to learn about tech recently and you could say it is the part of me that have been missing, i absolutely enjoy learning more and more about it as the days goes by, and i enjoy the limitless opportunities the tech world promises in terms of interacting with brilliant minds from all across the globe, and what you can achieve and design by applying your knowledge of tech etc.
- My short term goal is to master the css grid and flexbox which i have been learning for a week now.  
- My long term goal is to be a big name in the tech industry and also give back to the society by teaching others who may share the passion in creativity through tech. 
Until recently i have worked in several other lines which includes; Field data collection and analysis, marketting and a bit of humanitarian work, at my leisure time i love to sew and make beautiful dresses.
